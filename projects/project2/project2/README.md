# Project 02: Bubble Tea!

A simple bubble tea game to satisfy your bubble tea craving. 

## Artist's statement

My biggest inspiration for this project was that I work at a bubble tea shop and I wanted to make a small little interactive simulation about it. I wanted the user to be able to customnize their own bubble tea depending on what they like. To achieve this goal, I used the fundamentals we learned in class. I used the mousePressed function so the user is able to interact. I used OOP and loops to make the starting screen a little more playful by adding bouncing tapioca balls. I also added sound effects everytime the user press something. Although, I couldn't do the mini game at the end, I think I pretty much achieved my goal of making a bubble tea simulator. In the future, I hope I can create bigger projects. 

## Instructions

- Press the tapioca ball to start
